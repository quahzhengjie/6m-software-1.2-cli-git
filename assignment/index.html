        Hey there! I'm Zack, a software engineer with a passion for automation and digital acceleration. 
        I recently graduated from Rocket Academy's Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp and also have a Bachelor of Business (Honours) degree with a specialization in Marketing 
        and a MiniMasters in Finance from Nanyang Technological University. <br><br>
        I'm currently working at NielsenIQ as an APAC Automation Delivery Technical Specialist, 
        where I've led some pretty cool automation projects that saved the company loads of money. 
        I get a kick out of finding complex technical solutions, collaborating with process owners, and streamlining workflows. 
        I'm always looking for new challenges to enhance my skills and broaden my horizons.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not geeking out over code, you can usually find me hiking in the great outdoors or checking out the latest and greatest restaurants. 
        I love to pursue my hobbies and interests to keep a healthy work-life balance. I also enjoy volunteering for various organizations. 
        Giving back to the community is a big part of my life.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I'm just a curious guy who's always eager to learn new things and make a difference. 
        If you're interested in connecting or learning more about what I do, feel free to reach out!
        <br><br>
        As a technical specialist, I have experience managing virtual machines and MFT protocols, ensuring that data is secure and accessible. 
        As a software engineer, I am adept in the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), allowing me to develop web applications that are efficient and user-friendly.
        <br><br>
        As an automation specialist (RPA), I create innovative solutions using tools like OfficeScripts, PowerAutomate, VBA, and GoogleScripts, 
        streamlining processes and increasing productivity. 
        I am also passionate about tech education, and I take pride in helping my less tech-savvy colleagues become more proficient with the latest tools and software.
        <br><br>
        My diverse skill set allows me to be a valuable asset to any tech team or organization, and I am always looking for new challenges to further develop my expertise.
        <br><br>
        I am currently enrolled in the SCTP NTU Software Engineering to get hands on experience in React Native, Java, Spring Boot, and DevOps
